# Dean Martin – Baby, It's Cold Outside (Lyric Video)

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I really can't stay
(Baby it's cold outside)
I've got to go 'way
(But baby it's cold outside)
This evening has been so very nice
(Been hoping that you'd drop in)
(I'll hold your hands they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry
(Beautiful, what's your hurry?)
And father will be pacing the floor
(Listen to the fireplace roar)
So really, I'd better scurry
(Beautiful please don't hurry)
Well, maybe just a half a drink more
(Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think
(But baby it's cold out there)
Say? What's in this drink?
(?)
I wish I knew how
(Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break the spell
(I'll take your hat your hair looks swell)
I've ought to say no, no, no sir
(Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
(What's the sense of hurting my pride?)
I really can't stay
(But baby it's cold out-)
Baby it's cold outside
I simply must go
(But baby it's cold outside)
The answer is no
(But baby it's cold outside)
The welcome has been
(I'm lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm
(Look out the window at that storm)
My sister will be suspicious
(Gosh! Your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door
(Waves upon a tropical shore)
My maiden aunts mind is (?)
(Gosh! Your lips are licious)
Well, maybe just a cigarrette more
(?)
Say, lend me a coat
(It's up to your knees out there)
