I really can't stay (but baby it's cold outside)
I've got to go 'way (but baby it's cold outside)
This evening has been (been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)

My mother will start to worry (beautiful, what's your hurry?)
And father will be pacing the floor (listen to that fireplace roar)
So really I'd better scurry (beautiful, please don't hurry)
Well maybe just a half a drink more (put some records on while I pour)

The neighbours might think (baby it's bad out there)
Say what's in this drink? (no cabs to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (your eyes are like starlight now)
To break the spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)

I ought to say no, no, no, sir (mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
(What's the sense of hurting my pride?)
I really can't stay (baby don't hold out)
Ah, but it's cold outside

I simply must go (but baby it's cold outside)
The answer is no (but baby it's cold outside)
This welcome has been (how lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (look out the window at that storm!)

My sister will be suspicious (gosh your lips look delicious!)
My brother will be there at the door (waves upon tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (boy, your lips look delicious!)
Well maybe just a cigarette more (never such a blizzard before)

I got to get home (but, baby you'll freeze out there)
Say, lend me your comb (it's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I'll thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)

There's bound to be talk tomorrow (think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied
(If you caught pneumonia and died)
I really can't stay (get rid of that hold out)
Ah, but it's cold outside
